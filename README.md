# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis
To perform customer segmentation analysis for an e- commerce company. By analyzing customer behavior and purchase patterns, the goal is to group customers into distinct segments. This segmentation can inform targeted marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance overall business strategies.

1. Project Overview:
This project focuses on segmenting customers based on their purchase behavior using clustering algorithms. By analyzing customer information and purchase history, we aim to identify distinct customer groups and provide actionable business insights.

2. Objectives:
Collect and prepare customer data.
Explore and clean the dataset to ensure accuracy
Compute descriptive statistics to understand customer behavior.
Apply clustering (e.g., K-means) for customer segmentation.
Visualize and interpret results.
Provide recommendations for targeted marketing strategies.

3. Steps Performed:
a. Data Collection
Obtained dataset containing customer details, purchase history, and relevant attributes.
b. Data Exploration & Cleaning
Loaded dataset and examined its structure.
Checked for missing or inconsistent values and corrected them.
Verified data types for correct analysis.
c. Descriptive Statistics
Calculated average purchase value, purchase frequency, and total spending.
Identified key patterns in customer behavior.
d. Customer Segmentation
Applied K-means clustering to group customers with similar purchase patterns.
Determined optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.
e. Visualization
Created scatter plots and bar charts to represent customer segments.
Highlighted spending patterns and frequency for each segment.
f. Insights & Recommendations
Described characteristics of each customer segment (e.g., high-value frequent buyers, low-frequency bargain shoppers).
Suggested targeted marketing strategies for each segment to improve engagement and sales.

4. Tools & Technologies
Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization.

5. Outcomes
Clear identification of customer segments.
Data-driven insights for personalized marketing campaigns.

6. How to Run
Install Python 3.8+ and required libraries from requirements.txt.
Open Customer_Segmentation.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
Run all cells to reproduce analysis and visualizations.
